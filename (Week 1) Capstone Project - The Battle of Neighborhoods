A description of the problem and a discussion of the background.

Open a coffee shop in Wellington!

In the near future, I am going to live in New Zealand for at least 1 year and wondering which city 
would have interesting things to offer to me. In order to decide which city I am visiting, 
I need to analyze characteristics of several cities in New Zealand and see what they look like. 
However, it would be still complicating to me that I, as a beginner data scientist, would scrape 
various data in different cities and compare them in Python. Therefore, I would go for a simple premise, 
which is that I am going to live in Wellington, where actually IBM headquarters in New Zealand is located, 
and ICT and degitech industry are growing. 

Now I have decided to go for Wellington, but a problem still remains. 
In which part of Wellington would it be comfortable for me to stay? For that answer, 
I already have a clue, which is coffee! 

Let us say that I am coffee addicted and need to open my own coffee shop in Wellington to survive. 
What I am going to do is to check venues and inhabitants in each district and find out a place 
where there are many inhabitants with less competitors, coffee shops!
